                <h3>Who is JRR Tolkien</h3>
                <p>
                    John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, CBE, (3 January, 1892 – 2 September, 1973)
                    was a philologist and writer, best known as the author of The Hobbit and its sequel The Lord of the Rings.
                    He worked as reader and professor in English language at the University of Leeds from 1920 to 1925;
                    as professor of Anglo-Saxon language at the University of Oxford from 1925 to 1945;
                    and of English language and literature from 1945 until his retirement in 1959.
                    Tolkien was a close friend of C.S. Lewis, and a member of the Inklings,
                    a literary discussion group to which both Lewis,
                    Owen Barfield, and various other celebrated authors belonged.

                    Tolkien created a legendarium, a fictional mythology about the remote past of Earth,
                    of which Middle-earth in particular is the main stage.
                    Included in his legendarium are The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
                    along with The Silmarillion and The History of Middle-earth series (both posthumously published by his son,
                    Christopher Tolkien). Tolkien's other published works include philological essays,
                    modern adaptations of medieval literature and other stories not directly related to the legendarium,
                    many of which were originally stories written for his children.
                    Tolkien is often referred to as the "father" of modern fantasy 
                    and is widely regarded as one of the most influential authors of all time.

                <h3>His first book</h3>
                <p>
                    It was during his time as Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College,
                    in the late 1920s, that he semi-randomly scribbled the words "In a hole in the ground,
                    there lived a hobbit" on the back of a School Certificate paper that he was marking.
                    These words evolved into a story like the ones he was making up for his children.
                    He did not go any further than that at the time, although in the following years, he drew up Thrór's Map.

                    The tale itself he wrote in the early 1930s. 
                    It was mostly enjoyed by his eldest son John (13) than the younger ones.
                    His peers at Oxford also "forced" him to lend copies to read.
                    Eventually he lent it to the Reverend Mother Superior of the Cherwell Edge girl's hostel 
                    and to his former pupil Elaine Griffiths who was staying at Cherwell Edge, 
                    and it was seen by her student, Susan Dagnall, who worked at Allen & Unwin. 
                    The book was given to 10-year-old Rayner (son of Sir Stanley Unwin) who wrote an enthusiastic review of the book, 
                    encouraging his father to publish it.

                    The 1936 lecture "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics" has had a lasting influence on Beowulf research.
                    By January of 1937 Tolkien was corresponding with Allen & Unwin (who also showed interest in Mr. Bliss).
                    Around the time The Hobbit was published (1937) Tolkien suffered from an ailment and had to use crutches, 
                    the only time he was free from examining work.

                <h3>His second book</h3>
                <p>
                    The success of The Hobbit and a request by publishers for its sequel,
                    was an opportunity for Tolkien to combine his personal desire for writing and financial needs, 
                    and he agreed to write a sequel.
                </p>

                    In the turn of 1939, and in the midst of writing The Lord of the Rings, 
                    Tolkien faced financial stress and was obliged to do exams and lectures: 
                    his son, Michael was preparing for university, and Christopher, 
                    being home-schooled for health reasons, wanted to go to school.
                    In the summer of that year, while gardening, Tolkien fell and suffered a concussion which required stitches.
                    This, along with his fatigue, worries, obligations, Edith's illness, his loss of his chief assistant and understudy, 
                    prevented him from continuing his writing, including a foreword to Beowulf as had promised.
                    At the outbreak of WWII, his academic duties increased.
                    Juggling between work, "Civil Defence" and writing in intervals, he doubted that, because of the War, 
                    completing the book had any use. Failing to progress during Christmas vacations, he resumed only two years later. 
                    It was the enthusiasm of his friends and Christopher (to whom he was sending copies by mail to South Africa) who encouraged him to continue.

                    In 1945, he moved to Merton College, Oxford, becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, 
                    in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959.

                    Tolkien spent the late summer (August-September) of 1948, at the home of Michael at Payables Farm, Woodcote. 
                    As Michael and his family were on holiday, Tolkien found the time and quiet he needed to finish The Lord of the Rings, 
                    close to a decade after the first sketches.

                    After a disagreement with Allen & Unwin concerning "The Silmarillion", and failing to reach an agreement with Collins, 
                    he settled the dispute with the Unwins. He reported to Rayner Unwin that he had been unwell 
                    (having recovered from "a terrible bout" of fibrositis and neuritis of the arm) burdened and downhearted. 
                    In the prospect of a nearing retirement of poverty, during which he would work as an examiner to survive, and the rising paper costs, 
                    he had modified his views ("Better something than nothing!"). Tolkien readily agreed to the 'profit-sharing' arrangement, 
                    where Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even. 
                    Between 1953 and 1955 Tolkien worked closely with Allen & Unwin on the production of The Lord of the Rings, 
                    agreeing on the division of volumes, their titles, correcting proofs that arrived at intervals, complete and correct artwork, the maps and the dust-jacket designs.

                    In 1954 Tolkien was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters from both the National University of Ireland and the University of Liège for his work 
                    in his field of philology and medieval literature which delayed his work on the appendices, 
                    which then delayed the publication of The Return of the King.
